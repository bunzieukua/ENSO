This code serves a presentation about ENSO for one of my undergraduate courses.
In this file, you will find codes to plot sea surface temperature, Oceanic Ni√±o Index, and precipitation (with information of where I get those data).
You can modify the code to plot the data for your desired time period and/or location. It's highly recommended that you visit the databases to familiarize yourself with the data structure before proceeding with the code.

Special thanks to Climatematch Academy for teaching me how to adapt computational approaches in climate research! 
All the codes here are copied and pasted from the course content, with numerous modification to suit my research goal.
