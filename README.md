This code serves a presentation about ENSO for one of my undergraduate courses.
This is the code I used to plot sea surface temperature, Oceanic Ni√±o Index, and precipitation.
You can modify the code to plot the data for your desired time period and/or location.

Special thanks to Climatematch Academy for teaching me how to adapt computational approaches in climate research! 
All the codes here are copied and pasted from the course content, with numerous modification to suit my research goal.
